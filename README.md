# random-messages

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g suma-randoms
```

# Usage

```bash
suma-randoms
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [suma_randoms](git+https://github.com/Geaglts/suma_randoms_npm.git)
